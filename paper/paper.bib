  abstract = {Summary.  Estimation of structure, such as in variable selection, graphical modelling or cluster analysis, is notoriously difficult, especially for high dimensional data. We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

@article{Shi:2016,
abstract = {One important problem in microbiome analysis is to identify the bacterial taxa that are associated with a response, where the microbiome data are summarized as the composition of the bacterial taxa at different taxonomic levels. This paper considers regression analysis with such compositional data as covariates. In order to satisfy the subcompositional coherence of the results, linear models with a set of linear constraints on the regression coefficients are introduced. Such models allow regression analysis for subcompositions and include the log-contrast model for compositional covariates as a special case. A penalized estimation procedure for estimating the regression coefficients and for selecting variables under the linear constraints is developed. A method is also proposed to obtain debiased estimates of the regression coefficients that are asymptotically unbiased and have a joint asymptotic multivariate normal distribution. This provides valid confidence intervals of the regression coefficients and can be used to obtain the p-values. Simulation results show the validity of the confidence intervals and smaller variances of the debiased estimates when the linear constraints are imposed. The proposed methods are applied to a gut microbiome data set and identify four bacterial genera that are associated with the body mass index after adjusting for the total fat and caloric intakes.},
